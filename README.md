From the DataFrame pictured above one can se:
- There were 60 Vine reviews and 14,477 non-Vine reviews.
- There were 34 Vine reviews with 5 stars and 8212 non-Vine reviews with 5 stars.
- The precent of reviews which were 5 star was 56.67% for Vine reviews and 56.72% for non-Vine reviews.
## Summary: 
In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.

Considering the near identical percentage of 5 star reviews for both Vine and non-Vine entries the logical conclusion would be that there
is not a positivity bias for the reviews in the vine program. Additional analysis could be performed on the 1 star reviews to see if there is any bias.
