# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## Results:

From the DataFrame pictured above one can see:
- There were 60 Vine reviews and 14,477 non-Vine reviews.
- There were 34 Vine reviews with 5 stars and 8212 non-Vine reviews with 5 stars.
- The precent of reviews which were 5 star was 56.67% for Vine reviews and 56.72% for non-Vine reviews.
## Summary: 
Considering the near identical percentage of 5 star reviews for both Vine and non-Vine entries the logical conclusion would be that there
is not a positivity bias for the reviews in the vine program. Additional analysis could be performed on the 1 star reviews to see if there is any bias.
